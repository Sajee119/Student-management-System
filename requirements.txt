# Student Management System Requirements
# No external dependencies required - uses only Python standard library

# The system is built using only Python's built-in modules:
# - json (for data persistence)
# - os (for file operations and screen clearing)
# - sys (for system operations)
# - datetime (for date/time handling)
# - typing (for type hints)
# - re (for regular expressions)
# - csv (for CSV import/export)

# Python version requirement
# Python >= 3.7 (for type hints and modern features)
